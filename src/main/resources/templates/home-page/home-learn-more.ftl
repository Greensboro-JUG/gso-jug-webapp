			<br/>
			  <h2>-by Edson Yanaga, Director @ Redhat.</h2>
			  <br/>
            <p class="lead">

				Kubernetes-native serverless with Knative grants you the “magical” ability to scale to zero if your application component is underutilized.
				Perhaps more importantly, the skills and code you craft with Knative and Kubernetes are portable to all of the big cloud providers.
				In this session, we will show you how to get started and how to keep rocking with the interesting capabilities of Knative Serving and Knative Eventing.
