				Kotlin sure has been receiving a lot of buzz lately, is there something to it?
				Developed by JetBrains, Kotlin has been catching on lately because of its null safety
				guarantees, functional nature, type inference, full interoperability with Java,
				cross-platform support, and ease of use with Android and Spring.
				Is this something you and your team should consider spending time to learn?
				In this session we will go over what Kotlin is, what problems it solves,
				and what makes it stand out from other JVM languages. Youâ€™ll come away with enough
				knowledge to decide if this is something you and your team should consider adopting.
