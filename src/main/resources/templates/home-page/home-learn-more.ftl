	    						Java Modules are the future. However, our enterprise applications have legacy code, a lots of it. How in the world do we migrate from the old to the new? What are some of the challenges. In this presentation we will start with an introduction to modules and learn how to create them. Then we will dive into the differences between unnamed modules, automatic modules, and explicit modules. After that we will discuss some key limitations of modules, things that may surprise your developers if they are not aware of. Finally we will discuss how to migrate current applications to use modules.

	  						<div class="card card-body">
	    						The ideas of reactive systems and reactive programming has been around for a while. However, changes in many areas including how applications are deployed to how applications are used, including big data, have resulted in a renewed interest in this area. In this presentation we will start with a discussion of the nature of reactive systems and the characteristics of reactive applications. Then we will dive into design and architectural concerns we have to address to effectively create such system that can meet the demands of high volume, high frequency data and interactions.
